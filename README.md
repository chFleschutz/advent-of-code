# Advent of Code - Rust Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2023 implemented in Rust.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event where participants solve programming puzzles and challenges every day from December 1st to December 24th. 

## Running the Solutions

To get started, make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed on your system. 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chFleschutz/advent_of_code.git
```

2. Run the solution for `dayX`:

```bash
cd advent-of-code
cargo run dayX
```
Make sure to replace `dayX` with the specific day you want to run (e. g. 1 .. 24)
